# edge cases

- [x] add restaurant => edit restaurant => values are null, 0, undefined
- [x] add restaurant => add review => not saved to db because schema is missing
- [x] add a review without crushing all other data of resto
- [ ] add a restuarant => address is still shown even though null
- [ ] disabled button are still clickable
